name: The basics of HTML
theory: |

  Every day we look at dozens of Internet pages and read texts on them that are rendered as if from magazines. These pages are a hypertext - a system of Internet pages that can be navigated using links. To implement this system, there is the HTML language.

  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) â€” a language for marking up hypertext. By its function, HTML is a set of rules by which the browser distinguishes headings from lists, tables from pictures, and so on. HTML appeared in 1993 and was intended to standardize the rules for displaying text within web pages.


  Even this page is text that is described using HTML and processed by the browser. Technology has come a long way, but the concept of using HTML to mark up text remains unchanged many years later.

  Here is an example of HTML markup:

  ```html
  <section>
    <h2>Code Basics</h2>
    <p>
      Code Basics - free hands-on programming lessons for those
      who starts from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a complete beginner and want to learn the basics - the variables,
      strings, loops, functions, etc., then Code Basics is for you.
    </p>
  </section>
  ```

  Don't be intimidated by all the confusing words and signs - by the end of the course, you'll understand how the markup above works, and you'll know how to use the markup on your pages. Note that the whole point of the markup above is text. The rest are auxiliary elements in order to display the text where it was conceived by the designers and/or developers.
